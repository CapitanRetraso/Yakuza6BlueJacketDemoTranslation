@CapitanRetraso for ReARMP so that I can edit the text more easily                                                                                                                                      
@GarnetSunset for helping testing because I don't have a PS4 on hand and also for some db file stuffs (basically helping with translation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
~~and me obviously because I'm doing translation~~
